# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the completion of the URL shortener application by implementing the missing core functionality. The system needs to provide URL shortening capabilities, complete analytics processing, and integrate the frontend with the backend services. The goal is to transform the current proof-of-concept into a fully functional URL shortener with comprehensive analytics tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: URL Shortening Service

**User Story:** As a user, I want to submit a long URL and receive a short URL, so that I can share a more manageable link.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a valid URL THEN the system SHALL generate a unique short code
2. WHEN a short code is generated THEN the system SHALL store the URL mapping in D1 database
3. WHEN a URL is stored THEN the system SHALL cache it in KV store for fast access
4. WHEN an invalid URL is submitted THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
5. IF a short code collision occurs THEN the system SHALL generate a new unique code
6. WHEN a URL is successfully shortened THEN the system SHALL return the short URL to the user

### Requirement 2: Analytics Data Processing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want click analytics to be processed and stored, so that users can view detailed statistics about their links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a redirect occurs THEN the resolver SHALL send analytics data to the queue
2. WHEN analytics data is queued THEN the queue processor SHALL process it within 30 seconds
3. WHEN processing analytics THEN the system SHALL store data in the analytics table
4. WHEN storing analytics THEN the system SHALL handle duplicate events gracefully
5. IF analytics processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
6. WHEN analytics are stored THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and consistency

### Requirement 3: Frontend Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use a web interface to shorten URLs and view analytics, so that I can manage my links easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN they SHALL see a URL input form
2. WHEN a user submits a URL THEN the system SHALL display the shortened URL
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN they SHALL see their link history
4. WHEN viewing link history THEN users SHALL see basic analytics for each link
5. WHEN a user copies a short URL THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
6. IF URL shortening fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4: Database Schema Alignment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database schema to match the analytics data structure, so that data can be stored and retrieved correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analytics data is processed THEN all fields SHALL map correctly to database columns
2. WHEN creating the analytics table THEN it SHALL support all required analytics fields
3. WHEN storing analytics THEN the system SHALL handle optional fields appropriately
4. WHEN querying analytics THEN the system SHALL return data in the expected format
5. IF schema changes are needed THEN migrations SHALL be created to update existing data

### Requirement 5: API Endpoints

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want REST API endpoints for URL operations, so that I can build a complete user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling POST /api/shorten THEN the system SHALL create a new short URL
2. WHEN calling GET /api/links THEN the system SHALL return user's link history
3. WHEN calling GET /api/links/:id/analytics THEN the system SHALL return link statistics
4. WHEN calling DELETE /api/links/:id THEN the system SHALL deactivate the link
5. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
6. WHEN API calls succeed THEN the system SHALL return consistent JSON response formats

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully, so that I have a reliable experience even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN KV store is unavailable THEN the resolver SHALL fallback to D1 database
2. WHEN D1 database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
3. WHEN queue processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry failed messages
4. WHEN analytics processing fails THEN redirects SHALL continue to work
5. IF external services are down THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate diagnostic information
